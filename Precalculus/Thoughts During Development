No shapes can be defined unless there is a cartesian coordinate system to define them within
- Default cartesian coordinate system? Yes
Axises can be defined from points other than vertical or horizontal relativity

The outer edge of the display should be defined by the max and min points of the containing shapes? or by the cartesian coordinate system?

 - The cartesian coordinate system

The test scenarios within the test directory can be data producers, such that they feed the UI, Integration of Kotlin would be next.

Rather than having the drawing area stretch or shrink to fit. It simply provides a window as is for the view box.

The viewbox will stretch and shrink to fit. For instance.

in a drawing area of 800, 500

an area of 8000 by 5000 may be displayed as a result of the viewbox dimensions.

To utilize the curves, the shape can be determined by its type and curvature derived.

After creating a shape, it shows up in the list, including its center point
A list of shapes, points, lines, etc can be selected and edited within the gui via right click. even changing of the points

Mouse coordinates are displayed on the screen

What about fish lens? or different perspective orientations besides rectangular viewbox?

for a viewbox. it depends on the line and where it intersects with the viewbox boundary.

imagine a line being draw that is cut off at both the starting and ending points, but the middle section is seen.

How could such a line be detected?

the point would still need to be translated as proportional to the viewbox

Make it so the drawing area is movable. put a selectable gray line border.

This would decouple the drawing area from the rest of the window.

Locking the drawing area to the whole window can be an option, as well as locking the drawing area to some fraction of the window

This would also be true of other drawing areas, to where one drawing area takes up half of the window etc etc

Stretch/shrink to fit to largest coordinate would also be good

Should it stretch in perfect rectangularity? |-x| == x?

or |-x| != x?

Memory allocation overhead needs to be considered when revising the code, to new or not to new

Why is it that creating a circle with higher and higher radii doesn't register scaling correctly?

Why is it that upon forcing scaling to a massive proportion does the scaling reflect something expected?

There should never be a point that is entered that cannot be seen with the current setup, which is viewbox locked to bounding coordinates.

                        //In reality, the client side coordinate system should really just be taking in shapes
                        //From the kotlin server.
                        //to which, the producers of the shapes and movement information is being fed into kotlin

Shapes must handle their own generic instantiation process.
this means to further extend the available shapes,
a general format of construction and standardization of constructors must be followed.

CT is the load tester right now.

I'm thinking that Coding standards need to be written traversed and adhered to.
for at least the public vs private function names.
Refactoring such that files become much smaller would be a very good exercise as well.
