# Precalculus

//todo: rewrite this documentation so that it is relevant to only the drawing system 

The Projects current main focus is on the mathematical representation of shapes in a two dimensional plane and the repeatable functions throughout.
There are also fundamentals for trajectories of these entities, to serve as a basis for physics and orientation after time.
This is essentially a creativity based exercise of calculus based computing with attention to code organization.
There are many nice mathematical tricks, design patterns, and other schemes inherent.
The plan is to get the code out there, clean it up, organize and refactor and rinse and repeat.

Unfortunately for this project a lot less commits will be coming as I have obtained an internship opportunity. It is possible I will be moving this project to c++ and qt.
