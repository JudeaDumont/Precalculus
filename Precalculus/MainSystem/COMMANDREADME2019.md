C Circle 0 0 50000 2
If you run the "Display" program you can enter in the command "C Circle 0 0 50000 2"
This will create a circle with a radius of 50000 centered at 0,0 with 2 iterations worth of points.
if the lines of the axis extend to the outtermost points, then that is a pass for resizing axis on out-bounding plots

A cool testing procedure.
