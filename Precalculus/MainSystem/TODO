All the member access operators need to be checked if a handle can be used to replace a large grouping of them, when a member of a member of a member
is accessed multiple times within the same function.

Code needs to commented in general

Projectiles need to be tested for downward velocitys toward the left and right

planes need to coexist in some fashion

a large revision of everything regarding 3 dimensions might take place

In unity things just fall into negative infinity, I like the idea of a globally defined lower boundary more

methods that alter points should be refactored to pass functions to the transform points method

Bounce physics for projectiles are a possibility

material differentiation is a possibility that would change the physics of projectiles

Kotlin needs to made use of to build testing procedures

more tooling integration in the general should be a priority

The trajectories directory needs to be revisited and class components refactored for the most sensicle approach.

The line intersection function in point predicates needs to be refactored into a rays package, where the point with a
velocity unaffected by gravity is called a ray and may be sotred and utilized as such

The entire project needs to be checked for good aliasing

Organize Tests Better, where one entity of the code is tested very well for edge cases
